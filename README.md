MIDAS News Widget 
======

The news custom widget is a component of the [MIDAS platform](http://www.midasproject.eu/), side-by-side with other widgets like the MEDLINE custom widget, the heatmap ot the Twitter bot campaign monitor. In this reppository we release the code for this news custom widget and describe how it can be build and interact with other widgets. This custom widget is available through the MIDAS platform to monitor topics of interest and in line with the public health study of the overall dashboard. Thus, it cannot be installed independently from the MIDAS platform. Also, the news feed is served by the EventRegistry system through an API, which is another major dependency. In this widget, the user can explore the worldwide news dataset according to its own search, filtered on the topic pages of Event Registry, licensed to MIDAS as the external news dashboard.
